### Hi there! 👋

I'm **Chips**, a web developer, game developer, and creative technologist.

I design and build high-quality digital experiences from **modern web applications** to **immersive games** and **smart automation tools**. My focus lies in bringing ideas to life with clean architecture, premium UI, and smooth performance.

I’ve worked on projects that power communities, streamline workflows, and entertain thousands of users across multiple platforms. Whether it’s a dynamic sports website, a custom Discord bot ecosystem, or a gameplay prototype I take products from concept to polished reality.

Outside of development, I follow the latest in technology & game design, experiment with visual aesthetics, and occasionally break computers (only to rebuild them better).  
Gaming, art, and innovation keep me inspired — and always building the next big thing.

### Let’s connect and make cool stuff together!
