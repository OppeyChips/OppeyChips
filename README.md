### Hi there! 👋

I'm **Chips**, a web developer and game developer building modern web experiences and creative interactive worlds.

I focus on delivering clean, high-performance applications with thoughtful UI/UX.  
From sleek **Next.js** websites to **Unity** game prototypes, I design products that feel smooth, look premium, and actually solve problems.

I enjoy working on personal brands, community tools, and playful digital ideas — especially Discord bots and sports-themed platforms.  
Creating things that people genuinely enjoy using is what keeps me coding.

---

Outside of dev life, you'll find me exploring tech, leveling up in games, and experimenting with visual design.  
Always learning. Always building the next big upgrade.
